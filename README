Instructions differ with what you intend to do. If you would like to test our trained network, simply go to https://wine-predictor-63.herokuapp.com/
and enter the vintage, province, and price of the wine you'd like to predict. You must only select a wine from a province in the dropdown menu for 
the same field. After you've done this click "submit". If you'd like to try again with another wine, you can do so by simply going back a page in 
your browser. If you would like to train the network on a different dataset or simply retrain on the dataset we have then enter into your terminal 
in this directory "python3 wine_network_regression.py". If you aren't using a virtual environment with all of the modules installed that we use, then
ensure that you have these modules installed on your computer.
